We want drugs
We want love
We want sex
We want fun
We want changes
We want more
More than nothing
Or nothing at all
We want something new
We want something new

We are sad
And we are poor
We are hungry
And we are alone
We want drugs
We want to die
We want love
To dive in and die

We won't move
We won't work
We won't talk
We won't smile
We want changes
We want more
More than nothing
Or nothing at all
We want something new
We want something new

We are sad
And we are poor
We are hungry
And we are alone
We want drugs
We want to die
We want love
To dive in and die
