Walk the streets late at night
Uh my love (repeat)
Try to blade in try to hide
From you my love uh my love
I see the love sight each time they pass me by
Uh my love uh my love
I try to look away forget the memories of you
My love

I see the light that fills the night
It shines so bright I could .
U I try each day to stay away
But the streets wont leave me alone
Count the hours I count the days
Uh my love

Walk the streets late at night to get you outta my mind
Uh my love
I try to eun away as far as I can get from you
My love u my love
X2
Walk the streets late at night
Uh my love (repeat)
Try to blade in try to hide
From you my love uh my love
I see the love sight each time they pass me by
Uh my love uh my love
