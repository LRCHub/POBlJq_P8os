[00:03.27] A hundred dollars used to be more than enough
[00:06.90] And now a hundred times a day and still it's not enough

[00:25.60] All I know is all and all is all I've heard
[00:47.10] 
[00:33.63] I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
[00:37.44] But I love everybody else"
[00:41.88] And did you say: "I can't escape myself"
[00:44.85] And then you did and now there's no one else
[01:06.85]

[00:53.10] I'd like to help you out but things are rather tough
[01:03.99] People always tell me that you've got to lend a helping hand

[01:22.95] But I love everybody else"
[01:26.42] And did you say: "I can't escape myself"
[01:30.21] And then you did and now there's no one else
[01:52.21] 
[02:05.23] I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
