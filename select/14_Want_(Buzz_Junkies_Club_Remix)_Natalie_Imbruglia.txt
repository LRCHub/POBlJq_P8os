All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want

A round of applause, it's all that you want
Take a good look at what you give up
Because I'm telling you
A heart can't be unbroken oh, oh, oh, oh

And can you remember how I kiss you
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth
Cos baby the memory is all you get now
And I'm moving, movin, moving on

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I didn't
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I didn't

Does every morning make you happy
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep
I hope you find it easy to forget me oh, oh, oh, oh

I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
I wonder if you're out there having fun
I hope you get all that you really wanted
Cause I'm moving, movin, moving on

Don't you see the light has changed
And nothing looks the same
Just shadows on the ground
And if you listen carefully you'll hear

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I didn't
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
Cause I didn't
