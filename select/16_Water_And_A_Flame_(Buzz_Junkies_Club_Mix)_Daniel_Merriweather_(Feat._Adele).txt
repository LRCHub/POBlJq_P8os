Seven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

But your not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least that I'd know that you're okay.
A girl like you ain't meant to go away.
Oh...

Now you're gone,
Theres nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame.

Adele:
I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
Theres nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.

Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame...

Daniel:
If you see me coming...
Adele:
I look away, I look away...
Daniel:
And if your mind is made up...
Adele:
I look away, I will look away...

Daniel:
If your worry bound
Adele:
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
Daniel:
All this sorrow and this pain,
Is going to go away

Daniel & Adele:
Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame...
